<h2 align="center">Awards and badges</h2>
<p>There are a number of awards that may be achieved within Scouts, this section 
  shows how to use to database to record these awards for people within scouting.</p>
<h4>Definition of awards.</h4>
<p>All awards are defined by the system administrator and are available to all 
  members. The system does not handle awards that may be locally defined by various 
  groups for their members. Should you wish to have an award added, please contact 
  the system administrator.</p>
<h4>How awards are defined.</h4>
<p>In it's simplest form an award can be achieved by a member as one event, an 
  example may be an attendance badge, e.g. JOTA/JOTI.</p>
<h4>More complex awards.</h4>
<p>Many awards in scouting have a number of components that need to be achieved 
  before the whole award is granted. There may be mandatory components and optional 
  components, and a particular component may need to be completed a number of 
  times (e.g. Cub WERO's and KIWI badges). The database tracks all of these and 
  allocates the achievement when sufficient components have been completed.</p>
<p>Some awards have other awards as prerequisites, e.g. Swimmer stage 2 can only 
  be achieved after Swimmer stage one has been completed.</p>
<h4>Display of members awards</h4>
<p>Awards obtained by youth members are displayed on their personal information 
  page. </p>
<h4>Individual award achievement.</h4>
<p>When a youth member achieves an award/s it/they may be recorded by selecting 
  the &quot;Awards and badges&quot; button on the screen. This will display a 
  screen with more detailed achievement information split into 2 or possibly 3 
  sections.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0" align="left">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The left column shows awards already achieved. If the awards has not 
        yet been presented this will be indicated.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>The centre column, if it exists shows those awards that are &quot;work 
        in progress&quot;. Some components have been achieved, but more are needed 
        before the award is achieved.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>The right hand column shows those awards the member can currently achieve. 
        It does not display those for which the prerequisites have not been met. 
        i.e. if Swimmer stage 1 has not been achieved, Swimmer stage 2 will not 
        be displayed.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By selecting an award in the second or third column, a screen will be displayed. 
  The date achieved should be recorded and that either the whole award, or the 
  various components that have been achieved selected. A comment can be entered 
  regarding the achievement. </p>
<p>If the award has been achieved, a screen is displayed asking if the award has 
  been presented, if not reminders will be sent out (see below).</p>
<h4>Collective achievements</h4>
<p>Some awards can be achieved as a group and these can be entered together. On 
  the Unit display page (where you see a list of youth members in the club/pack/troop 
  etc.), select the button labeled &quot;Collective awards&quot;. Select the award, 
  and if appropriate the component, and you will then be presented with a list 
  of youth members. Select those that have achieved it, along with the date achieved 
  and a comment if appropriate and submit. The database will inform you of any 
  awards that have been achieved, and reminders will be send out, see below.</p>
<h4>Presentation of Awards/badges.</h4>
<p>The presentation of an award may not always be possible at the time it is achieved, 
  e.g. badges may not be available, or a leader may not be aware of the whole 
  achievement if only one sub-component has been completed, e.g. completing a 
  WERO. This information is displayed on the database system when entered and 
  is also e-mailed to appropriate people on a weekly basis. Once presented the 
  database must be updated to stop the emails being sent out.</p>
<p>To update the database, select the &quot;Awards and badges&quot; button on 
  the youth details screen. Select the award from the left column of the screen 
  and update appropriately.</p>
