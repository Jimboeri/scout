<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Scout Database system has been written to assist leaders at all levels 
  within the scout organisation to manage details about people involved in scouting. 
  It grew initially out of a desire to create a membership management system that 
  would allow leaders to manage thier own members without needing a central person 
  to do it all. The next challenge was to manage badges and awards, especially 
  in cubs.</p>
<h2>Structure of the database</h2>
<p>The database is structured so that any group in New Zealand could use it if 
  they wanted to, and leaders at district, area and national level could also 
  get useful information in the future. It is arranged as follows:</p>
<table width="50%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td>National level (Scouting NZ)</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Areas</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Districts</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Groups</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Units within the groups (cub packs etc)</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>The database stores each person associated with scouting as its own identity. 
  A scout/cub/kea etc is stored once and their parents each have thir own identity, 
  with a relationship existing between junior members (keas, cubs scouts etc) 
  and their parents. Chaning the address of a parent for example changes it for 
  all their children. This also enable parents that get more involved to be defined 
  as leaders without re-entering any information, they are justr assigned the 
  role that is appropriate to them.</p>
